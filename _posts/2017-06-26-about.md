About me
========

I'm currently a CS student, with an International Relations BA. I like to program interesting things, write strange fiction and code/compose electronic music. I like Linux, command lines, Lovecraft and the movie Shaolin vs Lama.

To the left (or on some devices up), you can see my family heraldry in cool and suave minimalist design.

Check out my [works]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-26-works %}), if you are interested. I'd like to think there are one or two pretty cool thing.
