About me
========

I'm currently a CS student, with an International Relations BA. I like to program interesting thing, write strange fiction and code/compose electronic music. I like Linux, command lines, Lovecraft and Shaolin vs Lama.

To the left, you can see my family heraldry in cool and suave minimalist design.

Check out my works, if you are interested. I'd like to think there are one or two pretty cool thing.
